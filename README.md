## Front end: WorkflowApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

The flowchart is applying [ng-flowchart](https://github.com/joel-wenzel/ng-flowchart). 

The frontend depends on [Bootstrap](https://v5.bootcss.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) v5.

The code editing area is [ngx-codemirror](https://github.com/scttcper/ngx-codemirror).

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
